# setredux

Single command to setup Redux store files and connect it with React

## Installation

You can install the locally:

```shell
npm install --save-dev setredux
```

Or install it globally (recommended) so you can use it on other projects without the need to install it again.

```shell
npm install -g setredux
```

## Usage

You just need to install the package as mentioned before and use it in your project.
So on the root directory of your React App just try the following command:

```
setredux init
```

## Output

The command outputs store in the following structure:

## Files Content


`configStore.js`

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

export default createStore(rootReducer);
```

`actions/index.js`

```js
// 'counter.actions' may hold multiple actions creators such as 'increment', 'decrement', etc.
// export * from './counter.actions';
```

`reducers/index.js`

```js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
// import counterReducers from 'counter.reducer';

export default combineReducers({
  // counter: counterReducer
});
```

## Options

`--connect`

If you want to let the command connect your **redux store** automatically to your React App, try to use the following option:

```shell
setredux init --connect
```

this will overwrite the existing content of `index.js` with the new content:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

import './index.css';
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';
import storeConfig from './store/storeConfig';
import App from './App';

const store = storeConfig();
const app = (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);

ReactDOM.render(app, document.getElementById('root'));

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://bit.ly/CRA-PWA

serviceWorker.unregister();
```

**_Just an additional option to the command_** ðŸ™‚

`--thunk`

You can use this option to add `redux-thunk` setup to your project automatically.

So if you used it ,`configStore.js` file will have the following content:
``` js
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import createDebounce from 'redux-debounced';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from 'redux';

import rootReducer from './reducers/index.js';

//*  create middleware
const middleware = [thunk, createDebounce()];

//* Debug & Dev Tools
const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;

//* Create store
const store = createStore(rootReducer, {}, composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(...middleware)));

export { store };
```
